# API-Authentication
The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out, access APIs, and more.
The Authentication API is served over HTTPS. All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base: https://{yourDomain}. 
For each endpoint, you will find sample snippets you can use, in three available formats:

HTTP request
Curl command
JavaScript: depending on the endpoint each snippet may use the Auth0.js library, Node.js code or simple JavaScript
Each request should be sent with a Content-Type of application/json.
